The goal of this project is to predict the survival rate of patients with brain tumors using the Multimodal Brain Tumor Segmentation Challenge 2020 dataset. The dataset consists of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans of brain tumors, along with clinical and demographic information about the patients. Three models were developed and compared for their performance in predicting survival rate. The first model used linear regression with preprocessed data using the GLOW Model. The second model used a convolutional neural network (CNN) with original data. The third model used Gaussian process (GP) with preprocessed data using the GLOW Model. Results were evaluated using metrics such as mean squared error and correlation coefficient. The findings of this study can potentially aid in the development of personalized treatment plans for patients with brain tumors based on their predicted survival rate.
